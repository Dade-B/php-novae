Core:
	core modules


ModuleLoader:
	the system for loading modules, whether core or not


Common:   #the word common represents that classes in here are classes common to multiple modules, such as the interfaces folder
	Interfaces:   interfaces that might be useful for modules to implement, that we're asserting to have good form,
		      in order to assist with modules having the ability to functionally replace themselves
